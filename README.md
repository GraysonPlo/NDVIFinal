# NDVI using R

This project was created uisng the following tutorial: https://jdmwhite.github.io/Intro_to_Spatial/NDVI_time_series.html .

## Introduction
The scope of this project was to better familiarize myself with the workings of R and R packages. In this project I used MODISTools and API to pull raster data from the MODIS database. I utilized terra in order to plot and use the rasters. 
Overall, during this project I selected an area within the Morro Bay Estuary and greatly expanded my knowledge in R and the usage of Git, Quarto, and Powershell to publish the website created.
